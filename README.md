# PRODIGY_ML_01
This repository contains a **Linear Regression model** that predicts house prices based on the square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.

## 📌 Task
The goal is to **predict house prices** using the following features:
- Square footage of the house
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms

## 🏆 Model Performance
The model was evaluated using common regression metrics:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: 165,005.83  
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: 239,061.44  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 57,150,374,258.67  
- **R-squared**: 0.5148
-
- ## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains the following house features:
- **Square footage**: The total area of the house in square feet.
- **Number of bedrooms**: The total number of bedrooms in the house.
- **Number of bathrooms**: The total number of bathrooms in the house.
- **House price**: The target variable, representing the price of the house.

## 📝 Additional Information
- The **Linear Regression** model was implemented using **Scikit-learn**.
- The model performance suggests that **R-squared = 0.5148**, meaning the model explains about **51% of the variance** in house prices.

## 📊 Knowledge Gained
- This project enhanced my skills in **linear regression** and model evaluation techniques.
- I gained insights into how **square footage**, **bedrooms**, and **bathrooms** influence house prices.
- I developed a deeper understanding of evaluating model performance and identifying areas for improvement.
